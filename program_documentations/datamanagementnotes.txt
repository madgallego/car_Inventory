Step1
	go to the index of the suv
Step2
	BinarySearch in terms of models

problem is transaction shit
Save the transaction date using Java's time shit idk

we have an array

Type
	Brand
		Model


therefore 3d

in configuration

	{transac1, transac2, transac3...}, arranged by date
	
for graphing shit, we can limit to whatever we want to graph. kung total, ireread nya lahat ng transaction sa 3d array and then do some 2d graphics shit to get the pixel idk idk

DURING RUNTIME

All cars are first initialized as basic CARS!!!
When trying to see the details of the cars like the features it has, we instantiate the class for the cars type
and fill in the info based on what the model is. 

So its like
Type
	Brand
		Model
			Honda SUV randomModel //still a basic car
We look at the contents of that car
Instantiate an SUV with that model then display the SUV's contents
