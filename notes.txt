E-PARADA 2.0 (JAVA) NOTES

Data Structures
 - Lack of structs in Java. Instead we implement classes
 - Classes are then stored in an ArrayList depending on what it is (Sales, UI, etc)
 
 SUPER CLASSES
 1. Universal Car Class
 -contains basic info such as car price, car weight, etc.
 - all other car types and brands inherits from this class
 2. Utils Class
 - contains static methods for calculations and such

 3. Universal UI Class
 - contains basic GUI info such as dimensions, RGBA, kung ano man needed for UI
 
 4. Data Class (Unsure)
 - contains monthly sales info. Fields are filled up by calculating the sales for different cars using the utils
 - graphing should utilize whatever is in here
 
 
 FLOW
 When Buying
 1. Select car model
 2. DO some payment processing
 3. Car ID is stored in the data class or file. ID represents branding, car type,  as well as a value that is unique
 4. Cross reference car ID with whats in the arrayList. Delete that member of the arraylist
 5. After a "month", create the points for the graphing

When analyzing
1. Select what to graph
2. retrieve the correct data for our grah
3. Present the graph to the screen
