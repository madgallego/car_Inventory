READ FROM FILE

Read all the properties
Instantiate a car depending on the said properties
Store the properties within the car object

per type

SUV			JEEP		SEDAN			Pickup		Sports


Read the ID and instantiate each car
Give correct properties based on car ID




EXAMPLE PURCHASE

bibili ako ng suv tas brand is Subaru model is Subaru ascent
Step1
	go to the index of the suv
Step2
	BinarySearch in terms of models
Step3 
	BinarySearch at the starting index of that model to the end index of that model until we find the correct product
Step4
	Remove the product
	
problem is transaction shit
Save the transaction date using Java's time shit idk

we have an array

Type
	Brand
		Model


therefore 3d

in configuration

	{transac1, transac2, transac3...}}, arranged by date
	
for graphing shit, we can limit to whatever we want to graph. kung total, ireread nya lahat ng transaction sa 3d array and then do some 2d graphics shit to get the pixel idk idk
